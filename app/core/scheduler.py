"""APScheduler integration.

Runs in the same process as FastAPI (single worker by design — see
Dockerfile). We schedule two jobs:

  1. `process_scheduled_bills` — every minute, picks up bills with
     `status='scheduled'` and `due_date <= now`, runs the decision
     agent again, and on `pay_now` directly calls
     `execute_payout(...)`. Multi-worker safety via
     `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`.

  2. `process_recurring_bills` — every 6 hours, finds bills with
     `is_recurring=True` whose `next_recurrence_date <= now` and
     spawns a fresh bill for the next period.

Job identifiers are stable so the scheduler can dedup on restart.
The scheduler is a no-op if the database is unreachable at startup
(it logs a warning and continues).

In production we use `AsyncIOScheduler` (needs a running event loop).
In test contexts we fall back to `BackgroundScheduler` so unit tests
don't need a loop.

The async payout call (`execute_payout` is `async def`) needs a
running event loop. We structure the job as a sync wrapper that
calls `asyncio.run()` on a private event loop. This works in both
BackgroundScheduler (job runs on a thread) and AsyncIOScheduler
(job runs in a separate thread of the AsyncIO loop) contexts.
